## **Overview**
**EcoDrop** is a state-level, 24-hour hackathon project that aims to create an intelligent, user-friendly platform focused on sustainable e-waste management. The project is being developed as part of the **Technothon** hackathon, where Iâ€™m working with my team members from Team **FRIEREN**. **EcoDrop** uses cutting-edge technologies, including **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Firebase**, **Gemini AI**, and **Mapbox API**, to provide an effective solution for citizens to dispose of their e-waste properly and track disposal points.

While the project is still in its early stages, our goal is to create a platform that can effectively guide users in their journey of responsible e-waste disposal, and we plan to add more features based on user feedback and further development.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Next.js 15**: For building the frontend with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances developer experience.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for real-time database management, image storage, and authentication.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for responsive, modern UI design.
- **Gemini AI**: Used to enhance user interaction with intelligent decision-making features.
- **Mapbox API**: For mapping and finding nearby e-waste collection centers.
- **Other Possible Features**: Additional technologies and APIs may be incorporated as needed.

## **Current Features**
1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication.
2. **E-Waste Disposal Location Tracking**: Using **Mapbox API**, the platform shows locations where users can drop off their e-waste.
3. **AI-Powered Assistance**: **Gemini AI** assists users in understanding and making smart choices related to e-waste management.
4. **Real-time Data**: **Firebase** is used to sync data across the platform, providing a seamless experience for users and administrators.
   
## **Future Features (Planned)**
1. **Gamification**: Reward system for users actively engaging in responsible e-waste disposal.
2. **Social Integration**: Ability to share progress and raise awareness about e-waste management.
3. **Admin Panel**: Admins can monitor e-waste drop-off locations, track user activities, and manage the platform efficiently.
